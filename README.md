# CodeAlpha_Age_calculate
In this, i have created a webpage in which you can calculate your age using javascript.
This HTML file contains JavaScript code to calculate a person's age from their date of birth:

The ageCalculator function is defined to perform the age calculation.
It retrieves the date of birth entered by the user.
If no date is entered, it displays a message asking the user to choose a date.
If a date is provided, it calculates the age and displays it.
The HTML structure includes:

A heading with a green color.
An input field for the user to enter their date of birth.
A message area to display error messages.
A button that triggers the ageCalculator function.
The result of the age calculation displayed in the form of "Age is: X years."
You can use this code to quickly calculate the age based on the date of birth.
